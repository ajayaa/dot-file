# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# After these four lines are applied, you'll have Vim-like bindings for
# copy-mode:
#   C-b [       Enter copy mode
#   C-b v       (in copy mode) begin copy selection
#   C-b y       (in copy mode) Copy selected text
#   r           (in copy mode) toggles between normal copy and block copy
#   C-b P       Paste selection in normal mode (Note, it is capital P)
#unbind p
